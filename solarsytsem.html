    <h1>SOLAR SYSTEM FOR KIDS</h1>
    <h3>Our solar system consists of eight planets which all orbit around our home star, the Sun.</h3>
    <div class="introduction"> 
        <p>Our planetary system was formed 4.6 billion years ago! For most of history it was thought that everything in space moved around the Sun, however around the 17th century the idea, that the earth is just one of the planets in the system, started gaining popularity.In fact, the Sun is only one of more than 200 billion stars moving about in the Milky Way!The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun. The Sun is mostly made out of hydrogen, and some helium.
            <img class="img1" src="./static/solar system.jpg" alt="solar system" width="50%">
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>There are eight planets in the solar system.They are mostly made of rock and metal, and they are mostly solid. The last four planets are called gas giants. This is because they are much larger than other planets and are mostly made of gas. The Solar System also contains other things. They are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mercury</li>
                    <li>Venus</li>
                    <li>Earth</li>
                    <li>Mars</li>
                    <li>Jupiter</li>
                    <li>Saturn</li>
                    <li>Uranus</li>
                    <li>Neptune</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The solar system also contains:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are asteroid belts, mostly between Mars and Jupiter.</li>
                    <li>Further out than Neptune, there is the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc.</li>
                    <li>These areas have dwarf planets, including Pluto, MakeMake,Haumea,Ceres and Eris. </li>
                    <li>There are thousands of very small objects in these areas.</li>
                    <li>There are also comets, centaurs, and there is interplanetary dust.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Six of the planets and three of the dwarf planets are orbited by moons. Furthermore, planetary dust orbits the gas giants. Many other systems like the Solar System have been found. Each of the billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy might have a planetary system.

                <h1>EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
                <div class="evolution">
                    <img class="img2" src="./static/evolutuon of solar system.JPG" alt="evolution">
                <p>The formation and evolution of the Solar System began 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk of loose dust, out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other Solar System bodies formed.
                    <br>
                    This model, known as the nebular hypothesis, was developed in the 18th (1700s) century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. It has been adjusted by scientific disciplines such as astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. As our knowledge of space has grown, the models have been changed to account for the new observations.
                    <br>
                    The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are believed to have formed and were later captured by their planets. Still others, as the Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions.
                    <br>
                    Many collisions between bodies have occurred, and have been important to the evolution of the Solar System. In the early stages, the positions of the planets sometimes shifted, and planets have switched places. This planetary migration is thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.</p>

                    <p>The Earth's orbit around the Sun is nearly a perfect circle, but when mapped it is found that the Earth moves around the Sun in a very slightly oval shaped orbit, called an elliptical orbit. The other planets in the Solar System also orbits the Sun in slightly elliptical orbits. Mercury has a more elliptical orbit than the others, and some of the smaller objects orbit the Sun in very eccentric orbits.</p>

                    <div class="discovery">
                    <p>For thousands of years, people had no need for a name for the "Solar System". They thought the Earth stayed still at the center of everything (geocentrism). Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos suggested that there was a special order in the sky, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematical system that described what we now call the "solar system". This was called a new "system of the world".

                        In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton began helping people understand physics more clearly. People began to accept the idea that the Earth is a planet and moves around the Sun, and that the planets are worlds with the same physical laws that control Earth. More recently, telescopes and space probes have led to discoveries of mountains and craters, and seasonal meteorological phenomena such as clouds, dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.

                    <p> The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitation. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.
                    <br>
                        All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons, two of which, Titan and Ganymede, are larger than the planet Mercury and, in the case of the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison.

                        At the center of the Solar System is the Sun. It is a star, like the billions of other stars in the sky.The Sun is important to us because it gives us heat and energy that allows life. None of the life on Earth could exist without the Sun.
                        <br>
The rest of the objects in the Solar System orbit (travel around) the Sun. The planets are the largest of these. The planets closest to the Sun are called the inner planets. These are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Then comes a big ring of asteroids, chunks of rock much smaller than planets. This ring is called the asteroid belt. Within the asteroid belt, there is a dwarf planet (smaller than a normal planet) named Ceres. Then come the outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Farther out there are two dwarf planets, Pluto and Eris

                        <p>Asteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar System bodies and are composed mainly of rocky and metallic minerals, with some ice. They range from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in size. Asteroids smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized).

                            The asteroid belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter. It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to form because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter.
